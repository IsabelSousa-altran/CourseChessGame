# CHESS GAME

In this project a chess game is created. It is possible for two people to play the game.
The game is played on the console. 
Each player places the position where the piece he wants to move is located and then places the position where he wants to move it. When the player chooses his piece it is demonstrated where it is possible to move that piece.
